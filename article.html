                    I have been drawing desktop wallpapers for Smashing Magazine’s monthly collections for over a
                    year
                    now, and every time it’s a very fun and challenging mission. In this article, I would like to
                    share
                    <strong>how I approach all stages of the process</strong> and provide general techniques for
                    creating vector
                    illustrations in Adobe Illustrator. Hopefully, you will find these techniques useful. While
                    referring to a particular drawing — the illustration for the “Understand Yourself” desktop
                    wallpaper, which was featured in <a href="index.html">May’s wallpaper collection this year</a> —
                    I’ll also highlight key
                    takeaways from my experience as an illustrator and designer.</p>

                <p class="inleiding"><img src="./images/website/artikel/I.png" alt="Big letter I with cat">I have

                <p class="alinea">The idea for “Understand Yourself” derived from my curiosity about the future
                    relationship between robots and human beings (artificial intelligence has become a thing
                    recently).
                    How would a robot go about understanding human emotions? By doing the same things that people
                    do, of
                    course. Hence, a pensive robot staring at the sunset.</p>

                <h2>Things To Consider Before Getting Started</h2>
                <ul class="alinea">
                    <li><strong>Resolution</strong>. Although vector artwork is scalable without compromising
                        quality, you have to
                        decide on the ratio. I prefer 4:3 and 16:9 because these are fairly common standards for
                        most screens. Also, bear in mind that, despite the perfect scalability of vector
                        graphics,
                        working with curve anchors and colors in small areas is sometimes onerous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition</strong>. Rules are made for breaking. But we should know which are
                        supposed to get broken, right? One that I really like is the <a href="index.html">rule
                            of
                            thirds</a>. It is easy and
                        it works well. The key idea is that main objects should be located at the intersections
                        of
                        the grid lines. If you are willing to learn more about composition, I can’t recommend
                        anything better than the book <a href="index.html"><em>Framed Ink.</em></a></li>
                    <li><strong>Depth</strong>. To make an illustration look more natural, create depth. You can
                        achieve this by placing some objects closer to the viewer and some farther.</li>
                    <li><strong>Framing</strong>. Don’t fret that some of your artwork will get trimmed; account
                        for
                        it while drawing. The rule of thumb is to think of your illustration as a clipping from
                        a
                        much bigger picture. While drawing, don’t try to squeeze all objects into the canvas;
                        let
                        them hang out. This is even more relevant if you are planning to turn your artwork into
                        a
                        wallpaper with multiple versions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Detail</strong>. Adding detail is a great way to make your illustration more
                        attractive. The more thorough the work is, the more one will want to explore it, and the
                        more truthful it will look. On the other hand, adding detail might (and most of the
                        times
                        does) take a lot more time than creating a decent illustration that you are satisfied
                        with.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Perfection</strong>. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. There is always someone
                        (future
                        you, as well) who is better at composition and coloring. Your drawing won’t be flawless,
                        and
                        over time you will notice a lot of things you didn’t pay attention to or just missed. At
                        the
                        same time, the only way to learn something is to make mistakes. That’s how it works.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>It's All About Storytelling</h2>
                <p class="alinea">
                    Since the dawn of the human race, storytelling has been one of the most exciting forms of
                    communication. It teaches, it captivates, it makes us think.
                </p>
                <p class="alinea">An illustration might look static, but it doesn’t have to be. Creating a story
                    within
                    a still image is easier than you might think. All you have to do is to imagine that your artwork
                    is
                    a middle frame of a movie. Technically, a movie is a sequence of images played at high speed, so
                    that the eye doesn’t notice the change of frames.</p>
                <p class="alinea">Think about what happened before the frame you are working on and what might
                    happen
                    after. Let’s think about what’s happening at the moment as well. What led to our frame? What are
                    the
                    causes and consequences?</p>
                <p class="alinea">The art of storytelling is not about what you tell the viewer, but rather how
                    people
                    perceive what you are telling. A good story sources its power from people’s emotions and
                    memories;
                    it resonates with the viewer.</p>
                <p class="alinea">As a quick example, below is one of my wallpapers featured in the <a
                        href="index.html">August wallpapers
                        collection</a>.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/website/artikel/camping.png" alt="Tent in a dark night">
                    <figcaption>The "Camping Time" illustration (<a href="index.html">View large version</a>)
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="alinea">And this is a message I received shortly after it was published, from Paweł
                    Montwiłł in Poland:</p>

                <blockquote>I have recently been to a campsite with my children and we spent some time in a
                    tent, so
                    it perfectly matches my mood.</blockquote>

                <p class="alinea">Chances are, what genuinely interests you will be appreciated by others, too.
                </p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p class="alinea">The background is extremely important because it sets the mood and affects the
                    colors you will pick later for the hero and the surroundings.
                </p>
                <p class="alinea">Open Adobe Illustrator, and create a new document by hitting <code>Cmd/Ctrl +
                        N</code>. Type
                    <code>2560px</code> in the “Width” field and <code>1440px</code> in the “Height” field.
                    Choose
                    RGB color mode, because we
                    are creating an illustration that will be used on digital screens only. (Note: <code>Shift +
                        0</code>
                    activates the artboard editing mode, so you can change the dimensions of the artboard if you
                    want to alter them or in case you typed them in wrong.)</p>
                <p class="alinea">Hit <code>M</code> to select the Rectangle tool, and click anywhere on the
                    artboard. Type in
                    the same width and height values as your artboard’s (<code>2560px</code> and
                    <code>1440px</code>).</p>
                <figure><img src="./images/website/artikel/explan.png" alt="Screenshot Rectangle tool Illustrator">

                </figure>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="alinea">Illustration is a great way to boost many of your skills and to experiment
                    with
                    drawing techniques, colors and composition. These skills will make you a better specialist
                    in
                    any creative field (such as animation and web design, to name a couple). Just remember that
                    a
                    solid illustration requires patience and is rarely done quickly. The good news is that it
                    pays
                    off.</p>

                        <p>Comments are moderated and will only be made live if they add to the discussion in a
                            constructive way. If you disagree with a point, be polite. This should be a conversation
                            between
                            professional people with the aim that we all learn. If your comment is about a typo, problem
                            with
                            the

                        <p>We use <em>GitHub Flavored Markdown</em> for comments. E.g., you can call out code or a
                            command within a
                            sentence
                            with single backticks (<span>`command`</span>). To format code into its own distinct block,
                            please
                            use
                            triple backticks
                            (<span>```code block```</span>).</p>
